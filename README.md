# 🤖 Self-Created Repository

This repository wasn't just created for an assessment — it was created *by* the very AI Agent whose codebase is contained within it.

## 🔍 What is This?
This repository serves as a fascinating experiment in automation and AI agent operations.
The Agent whose Architecture is contained within generated this repository programmatically using the toolset made available by compose.io (https://composio.dev/) and its skeletal structure based on Langgraph (https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)


## 🛠️ Features
- **Autonomous Repository Creation** – The bot initialized this repository on its own.
- **Self-Contained Codebase** – The logic behind this automation is included within the repo.
- **Potential for Expansion** – This serves as a foundation for further automation experiments.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository is both a demonstration and a starting point for further exploration into autonomous AI-driven development.
